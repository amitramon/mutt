# This script invoke Emacs to edit Mutt's mail _inside_ the mlterm's
# terminal (and not in its own frame). Now that both Emacs and mlterm
# support bi-directional text there is a problem when running Emacs
# inside a BIDI-aware terminal - a RTL text will be 'inverted' by both
# Emacs and mlterm, so the net result will be RTL text that is written
# LTR.  This scrips tries to workaround this problem by turning off
# mlterm's BIDI before launching Emacs, and turn it back on after
# Emacs exits.

# In order to do all of the above the following conditions have to be
# met:

# - mlterm must has a class name `my-mail-term'. This is achieved by
#   launching it with the `name' option.
# - mlterm should have keys defined as follows:
# Control+Shift+F19="proto:use_bidi=false"
# Control+Shift+F20="proto:use_bidi=true"
