# Send (and message) hooks

## From and Signature ##
# The default account is now chosen by a folder-hook, see there for more information.
# send-hook .* 'my_hdr From: john smith <smith@example.com>'
# send-hook .* 'set from="john smith <smith@example.com>"'

# Example:
# set initial signature:
# send-hook .* 'set signature="~/.signature"'
# the signature for special cases: body analysis to determine signature
# set my_friendlywords='~b "(kiss|hug|love)"'
# message-hook	"!~l (~L john|~B '[^[:alpha:]]angel[^[:alpha:]]') $my_friendlywords"	'set signature="~/.mutt/signatures/angel.informal"'

# reset the sendmail command to the default one:
send-hook ~A 'source $my_default_sendmail_config'

# debugging: append this to the previous comman for logging activity:
# ; set my_dummy=`VAR="";test-log "in send-hook";echo "DUMMY"`'

# set the 'sendmail' command to send the message as is (i.e., text/plain)
# for recipient matching this hook's pattern:
# ~l: catch all mail sent to lists (use 'subscribe' or 'lists' mutt command)
send2-hook ~l 'source $my_sendmail_plain_config'

# set the 'sendmail' command to send the message as HTML
# for recipient matching this hook's pattern:
# send2-hook "!~l %C gmail-users" 'source $my_sendmail_html_config'
